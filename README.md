## Technologies
Built with React and TypeScript by Vite. I designed the UI with Chakra(https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started). For fetching data effectively and improving the UI responsiveness, the server state was managed with 'React Query,' and the client state management was done with 'zustand' (https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand). I also used the 'react-router-dom' package to implement React Router (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom). This web app was deployed to Vercel.
