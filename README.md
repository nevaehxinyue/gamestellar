# GameStellar  🪐
A web game discovery app that helps you find popular and interesting games to play. With GameStellar, you can easily search for games by genre and platform, and you can also explore top games of recent years. 

Web hosted here -> https://gamestellar.vercel.app/

## Technologies
Built with React and TypeScript by Vite. I designed the UI with Chakra(https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started). For fetching data effectively and improving the UI responsiveness, the server state was managed with 'React Query,' and the client state management was done with 'zustand' (https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand). I also used the 'react-router-dom' package to implement React Router (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom). This web app was deployed to Vercel.
